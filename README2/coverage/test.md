# AdminNeo Coverage Page

This page provides a **code coverage dashboard** for AdminNeo, allowing developers to monitor which parts of the code are tested, untested, or dead. It integrates with **Xdebug** to collect coverage data and visualize it in a modern, interactive way.

## Features

- **Overall Coverage Summary**
  - Shows total % coverage across all files at the top of the page.

- **File-Level Coverage**
  - Lists all relevant PHP files (`admin/`, `editor/`, `core/`, `drivers/`) with percentage coverage.
  - Color-coded:  
    - **Green** ‚Üí High/tested coverage  
    - **Yellow** ‚Üí Medium coverage  
    - **Red** ‚Üí Low/untested coverage  
    - **Gray** ‚Üí Dead code

- **Line-Level View**
  - Click on a file to see coverage per line.
  - Lines are highlighted as **tested**, **untested**, or **dead**.
  - Hovering can show line status (planned enhancement for tooltips).

- **Filter by Folder**
  - Quickly filter files by folder (`admin/`, `editor/`, or all).

- **Export Coverage**
  - Export all file coverage stats as **CSV** for CI/CD integration.

- **Start/Stop Coverage**
  - Toggle coverage collection with a single button.

- **Legend**
